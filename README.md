## Abstract

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are splashed across news headlines on a regular basis, 
charting a wild ride of extreme highs and lows. Once the sole domain of anti-establishment 
millennials burned by the 2008 recession, many institutional investors have shed their 
skepticism and are dipping their toes into the crypto market, adding exposure through 
crypto funds, futures, and other emerging investment options. The world of crypto investing 
is still relatively uncharted territory. It is important to understand what cryptocurrencies are 
before investing or accounting for them. Organizations that take a step-by-step approach to 
due diligence and gain experience with small, low-risk projects involving cryptocurrencies 
may find they present exciting, new opportunities.

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that is an intangible, digital currency that uses a 
highly sophisticated type of encryption called cryptography to secure and verify transactions 
as well as to control the creation of new units of currency. It is designed to work as a 
decentralized medium of exchange, independent of a financial institution or any other central 
authority. While Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it is not the only one. Other 
major types of cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.
There are also other digital assets (or “crypto assets”).
